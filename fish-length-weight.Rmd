# This is a big title!

## *this is a fancy subtitle!*

## **We will be working with fish weights**

<!--\#![alt text here](path-to-image-here) maybe how we add a pic?-->

### Function to Estimate Fish Standard Weight

#### Using this equation

`W = aL^b^`

```{r}
stand_weight <- function(a, b, L) {
  a*L^b
} #function to find the mass
milkfish <- stand_weight(a = 0.0905, b = 2.25, L = 60) #each different fish at 60cm 
g_trevally <- stand_weight(a = 0.0353, b = 3.05, L = 60)
g_barracuda <- stand_weight(a = 0.0181, b = 3.27, L = 60)

fish_length <- seq(from = 0, to = 200, by = 1)
barracuda_weight <- stand_weight(a = 0.0181, b = 3.27, L = fish_length)
```

### And Now We Bind!

```{r}
fish_df <- data.frame(fish_length, barracuda_weight)
```

### And Then a \~Beautiful Graph\~

```{r}
ggplot(data = fish_df, aes(x = fish_length, y = barracuda_weight)) + 
  geom_point(color = "light blue")  +
  labs(x = "Length of Fish (cm)", 
       y = "Barracuda (Individuals)", 
       title = "Weight Flux in Gaint Barracuda",
       caption = "As the Barracuda grow in length their weight increases at an exponential rate") +
  theme_classic()
```
